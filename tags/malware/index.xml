      <description>In this article I will cover how the UPX packer works and how to manually unpack it.
For the purpose of demonstration I will unpack a sample of the infamous conti ransomware, which we see a lot in the wild these days, and is using UPX packer.
What is it UPX? UPX (the Ultimate Packer for Executables) is an open-source packer, based on the UCL compression algorithm. It is a very common and well known packer, which is also considered to be an easy one to unpack.</description>

      <description>A new version of cracked Gomorrah builder was leaked today so I thought this might be a good subject for my first publication on this blog.

First Look After executing the builder we can see a simple window with a textbox and one button.</description>
