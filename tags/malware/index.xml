      <description>In this article I will cover how the UPX packer works and how to manually unpack it.
For the purpose of demonstration I will unpack a sample of the infamous conti ransomware, which we see a lot in the wild these days, and is using UPX packer.
What is it UPX? UPX (the Ultimate Packer for Executables) is an open-source packer, based on the UCL compression algorithm. It is a very common and well known packer, which is also considered to be an easy one to unpack.</description>

Some Background Gomorrah is a stealer that made its first appearance around March 2020. its written in a .NET language and almost doesn&amp;rsquo;t use any obfuscation or anti-debugging techniques, thus making it fairly easy to reverse and analyze it.
First Look After executing the builder we can see a simple window with a textbox and one button.</description>
