      <description>Last week a group of researchers at neo_sec came across an intersting maldoc that uses a remote HTTP template inorder to achieve RCE.
original tweet:
This malicious document loads a remote HTML temlpate and launch ms-msdt (Microsoft Diagnostic Tool) with special parameters that enable code execution. This method doesn&amp;rsquo;t requires enabling the content because it doesn&amp;rsquo;t relay on Macros. In addition this CVE is even allows code execution from preview view which makes it a 0Click exploit.</description>

So I download the maldoc and run olevba to dump the macros, but nothing was found.
Interesting.. Ok, Let&amp;rsquo;s find out what is going on.
