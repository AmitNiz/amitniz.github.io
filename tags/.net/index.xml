      <description>A new version of cracked Gomorrah builder was leaked today so I thought this might be a good subject for my first publication on this blog.

Some Background Gomorrah is a stealer that made its first appearance around March 2020. its written in a .NET language and almost doesn&amp;rsquo;t use any obfuscation or anti-debugging techniques, thus making it fairly easy to reverse and analyze it.
First Look After executing the builder we can see a simple window with a textbox and one button.</description>
