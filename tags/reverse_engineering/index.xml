      <description>Today I&amp;rsquo;m going to talk about a very powerful binary instrumentation toolkit named Frida,
And use it to investigate and solve an android crackme app.
Note: I&amp;rsquo;m going to assume that you already know how to connect to an android device or emulator via adb.
What is Frida? Frida is a binary intrumentation toolkit, that lets you inject JS code or your own library into native apps on almost every possible platform (Window, MacOs, Linux, IOS, Android and QNX).</description>

      <description>In this article I will cover how the UPX packer works and how to manually unpack it.
For the purpose of demonstration I will unpack a sample of the infamous conti ransomware, which we see a lot in the wild these days, and is using UPX packer.
What is UPX? UPX (the Ultimate Packer for Executables) is an open-source packer, based on the UCL compression algorithm. It is a very common and well known packer, which is also considered to be an easy one to unpack.</description>
